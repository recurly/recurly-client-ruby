module Recurly
  # The Purchase object works a slightly differently than the rest of the models.
  # You build up the purchase data into an object then pass to either:
  # {Purchase.invoice!} or {Purchase.preview!} and it will
  # return an {Invoice}.
  #
  # You can build your purchase object with a new account or an existing account.
  # For an existing account, you just need an account_code:
  #   Recurly::Purchase.new({account: {account_code: 'myexistingaccount'}})
  # or
  #   account = Recurly::Account.find('existing_account')
  #   Recurly::Purchase.new({account: account})
  # or
  #   account = Recurly::Account.find('existing_account')
  #   purchase = Recurly::Purchase.new
  #   purchase.account = account
  #
  # For a new account, you can pass in {Account} data, {BillingInfo} data, etc
  # in the same way you would when creating a {Subscription} with a new account.
  #
  # You can also pass in adjustments and invoicing data to be passed to the invoice.
  # Here is an example of a Purchase with a new account:
  #   require 'securerandom'
  #
  #   purchase = Recurly::Purchase.new({
  #     currency: 'USD',
  #     collection_method: :automatic,
  #     account: {
  #       account_code: SecureRandom.uuid,
  #       billing_info: {
  #         first_name: 'Benjamin',
  #         last_name: 'Du Monde',
  #         address1: '400 Alabama St',
