      # @!attribute auto_renew
      #   @return [Boolean] Whether the subscription renews at the end of its term.
      define_attribute :auto_renew, :Boolean

      # @!attribute collection_method
      #   @return [String] Change collection method
      define_attribute :collection_method, String

      # @!attribute custom_fields
      #   @return [Array[CustomField]] The custom fields will only be altered when they are included in a request. Sending an empty array will not remove any existing values. To remove a field send the name with a null or empty value.
      define_attribute :custom_fields, Array, { :item_type => :CustomField }

      # @!attribute customer_notes
      #   @return [String] Specify custom notes to add or override Customer Notes. Custom notes will stay with a subscription on all renewals.
      define_attribute :customer_notes, String

      # @!attribute net_terms
      #   @return [Integer] Integer representing the number of days after an invoice's creation that the invoice will become past due. If an invoice's net terms are set to '0', it is due 'On Receipt' and will become past due 24 hours after it’s created. If an invoice is due net 30, it will become past due at 31 days exactly.
      define_attribute :net_terms, Integer

      # @!attribute next_bill_date
      #   @return [DateTime] If present, this sets the date the subscription's next billing period will start (`current_period_ends_at`). This can be used to align the subscription’s billing to a specific day of the month. For a subscription in a trial period, this will change when the trial expires. This parameter is useful for postponement of a subscription to change its billing date without proration.
      define_attribute :next_bill_date, DateTime

      # @!attribute po_number
      #   @return [String] For manual invoicing, this identifies the PO number associated with the subscription.
      define_attribute :po_number, String

      # @!attribute remaining_billing_cycles
      #   @return [Integer] The remaining billing cycles in the current term.
      define_attribute :remaining_billing_cycles, Integer

      # @!attribute renewal_billing_cycles
      #   @return [Integer] If `auto_renew=true`, when a term completes, `total_billing_cycles` takes this value as the length of subsequent terms. Defaults to the plan's `total_billing_cycles`.
      define_attribute :renewal_billing_cycles, Integer

      # @!attribute revenue_schedule_type
      #   @return [String] Revenue schedule type
      define_attribute :revenue_schedule_type, String

      # @!attribute shipping
      #   @return [SubscriptionShippingUpdate] Subscription shipping details
      define_attribute :shipping, :SubscriptionShippingUpdate
