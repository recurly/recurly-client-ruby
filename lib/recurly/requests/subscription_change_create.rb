      # @!attribute add_ons
      #   @return [Array[SubscriptionAddOnUpdate]] If you provide a value for this field it will replace any existing add-ons. So, when adding or modifying an add-on, you need to include the existing subscription add-ons. Unchanged add-ons can be included just using the subscription add-on''s ID: `{"id": "abc123"}`. If this value is omitted your existing add-ons will be unaffected. To remove all existing add-ons, this value should be an empty array.'  If a subscription add-on's `code` is supplied without the `id`, `{"code": "def456"}`, the subscription add-on attributes will be set to the current values of the plan add-on unless provided in the request.  - If an `id` is passed, any attributes not passed in will pull from the   existing subscription add-on - If a `code` is passed, any attributes not passed in will pull from the   current values of the plan add-on - Attributes passed in as part of the request will override either of the   above scenarios

      define_attribute :coupon_codes, Array, { :item_type => String }

      # @!attribute custom_fields
      #   @return [Array[CustomField]] The custom fields will only be altered when they are included in a request. Sending an empty array will not remove any existing values. To remove a field send the name with a null or empty value.
      define_attribute :custom_fields, Array, { :item_type => :CustomField }

      # @!attribute net_terms
      #   @return [Integer] Integer representing the number of days after an invoice's creation that the invoice will become past due. If an invoice's net terms are set to '0', it is due 'On Receipt' and will become past due 24 hours after itâ€™s created. If an invoice is due net 30, it will become past due at 31 days exactly.
      define_attribute :net_terms, Integer

      # @!attribute plan_code
      #   @return [String] If you want to change to a new plan, you can provide the plan's code or id. If both are provided the `plan_id` will be used.
      define_attribute :plan_code, String

      # @!attribute plan_id
      #   @return [String] If you want to change to a new plan, you can provide the plan's code or id. If both are provided the `plan_id` will be used.

      define_attribute :shipping, :SubscriptionChangeShippingCreate

      # @!attribute timeframe
      #   @return [String] The timeframe parameter controls when the upgrade or downgrade takes place. The subscription change can occur now, when the subscription is next billed, or when the subscription term ends. Generally, if you're performing an upgrade, you will want the change to occur immediately (now). If you're performing a downgrade, you should set the timeframe to `term_end` or `bill_date` so the change takes effect at a scheduled billing date. The `renewal` timeframe option is accepted as an alias for `term_end`.
