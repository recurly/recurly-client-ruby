  description: |
    # Getting Started

    ## Versioning
    The V3 API is versioned to allow stability for integrators and
    flexibility for Recurly to continue making improvements.

    The versions follow a format that incorporates the approximate date the
    changes were released in a YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. `v2019-10-10`.

    > *WARNING*: Specifying a version is required to get a successful response.

    Each request should specify a version using the `Accept` header:
    * `Accept: application/vnd.recurly.v2019-10-10`
    * `Accept: application/vnd.recurly.v2019-10-10+json`

    All responses will include a `Recurly-Version` header with the API version
    used to process the request:
    ```
    Recurly-Version: recurly.v2019-10-10
    ```

    ### Default Versions
    Specifying a version is required to get a successful response. If you wish to
    receive the latest version and are willing to accept the risk of breaking changes,
    you may specify a version of `latest`.

    The following media types will default the newest version of
    the API:

    * `application/vnd.recurly.latest`
    * `application/vnd.recurly.latest+json`

    ### Deprecation
    Responses for a deprecated version request will return two headers:
    ```
    Recurly-Deprecated: TRUE
    Recurly-Sunset-Date: 2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00
    ```
    The sunset date is an ISO-8601 formatted date time after which the version
    will no longer be accessible.

    ### Unsupported Versions
    A request for an unsupported version will return a status code of 406 and
    the body will include a list of supported versions:
    ```
    {
      "error": {
        "type": "invalid_api_version",
        "message": "That accept header isn't in the format we use to specify an API version. Try one of these instead:",
        "acceptable_accept_headers": [
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2016-03-01",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2016-04-27",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2016-07-27",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2016-12-15",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2017-01-12",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2017-09-30",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2018-01-24",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2018-05-10",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2018-06-06",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2018-08-09",
          "application/vnd.recurly.v2019-10-10"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Error Messages
    Error messages sent via the Recurly API are generally directed at
    developers and those who are familiar with API technology. When using the
    API and passing error messages to target systems, be mindful that
    these messages may not make sense in the context of the target system.
    Please consider changing these messages in target system to be better
    suited to the audience of the system.

    ## Pagination
    ### Response Schema
    Every GET listing endpoint returns a response with the same schema:

    ```
    {
      "object":   "list",         // Always "list"
      "has_more": true,           // false if this is the last page of data
      "next":     "https://...",  // A URL pointing to the next page of data
      "data":     []              // The data for this page as an array
    }
    ```

    To page through every record, your code should continually call the URL
    at `next` until `has_more` is `false`.

    ### Query Parameters
    Most GET listing endpoints take query parameters that allow filtering
    and sorting the results. Some endpoints have additional parameters, which are
    documented on the respective endpoints, but most support the
    following parameters:

    * `ids`: A comma separated list of ids to match.
    * `limit`: The number of records to return per page.
    * `order`: The sort order of records.
    * `sort`: The date field to use in sorting.
    * `begin_time`: The start datetime to filter (ISO 8601).
    * `end_time`: The end datetime to filter (ISO 8601).

    ### Counting with HEAD
    Every GET listing endpoint also supports the HEAD HTTP method. Making a
    head request to the endpoint results in an empty body and an additional
    `Recurly-Total-Records` header. This is a count of the total number of records
    that the endpoint will return, taking into account the current filtering query
    parameters.

    ## Limits
    In order to provide a fast response time to all our customers, we may rate
    limit excessive requests. By default, new Recurly sites have the following
    API rate limits:

    * Sandbox sites: 400 requests/min. All requests count towards the rate limit.
    * Production sites: 1,000 requests/min. Only GET requests count towards the rate limit.

    Once your site moves into production mode, Recurly will only rate limit
    GET requests. New subscriptions, account modifications, and other requests
    using POST, PUT, or DELETE methods will not count against your rate limit.

    The rate limit is calculated over a sliding 5 minute window. This means a
    production site could make 4,000 requests within one minute and not hit
    the rate limit so long as the site made less than 1,000 requests during
    the prior 4 minutes.

    If an API request exceeds the rate limit, the API will return a
    `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status. If your business needs a higher
    limit, please contact support.

    The rate limit applied to your client can be determined with the
    `X-RateLimit-Limit` header, and the number of remaining requests is sent
    in the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header. Finally, the `X-RateLimit-Reset`
    header contains an integer value representing the time, measured in
    seconds since the UNIX Epoch, at which the request count will be reset.

        There are two ways to do a refund:
        * refund a specific amount which is divided across all the line items.
        * refund quantities of line items.
        If you want to refund the entire refundable amount on the invoice, the
        simplest way is to do `type=amount` without specifiying an `amount`.

        * The `ids` parameter cannot be used with any other ordering or filtering
          parameters (`limit`, `order`, `sort`, `begin_time`, `end_time`, etc)
        * Invalid or unknown IDs will be ignored, so you should check that the
          results correspond to your request.
        * Records are returned in an arbitrary order. Since results are all
          returned at once you can sort the records yourself.
